Privacy Policy for Green Bunny

  Last Updated: August 22, 2025

  Hi, I'm the developer of Green Bunny. Thank you for using my extension!

  This page explains what Green Bunny does and does not do with your data.

  The Simple Version

  I do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.

  I believe that simple tools should be simple in every way, and that includes respecting your
  privacy. I have no interest in your browsing history, what you watch, or who you are.

  To be perfectly clear, this extension:

   * NEVER tracks your browsing activity.
   * NEVER collects any personal information.
   * NEVER sends any data to a remote server. Everything the extension does happens only inside
     your browser.
   * NEVER shows advertisements.

  How Settings Are Saved

  To save your preferences (like your hotkeys or default speed, which are planned future
  features), the extension will use the standard chrome.storage API. This data is saved only on
  your own computer and is never sent to me or anyone else.

  Questions?

  If you have any questions at all about your privacy, please feel free to email me directly at
  GentleKyle.dev@gmail.com.
