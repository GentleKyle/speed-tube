# speed-tube
Sometimes you just wanna go fast and YouTube does not get it.  
They cap your speed at 2.0, but I want more. This allows it.

Changes default playback speed and adds some keybinds for quick adjustments while visiting YouTube.

Ctrl + Down Arrow --- decreases playback speed  
Ctrl + Up Arrow --- increases playback speed

This is not an official extension so you need to load it a little differently.

1. Download ZIP and extract
2. Go to browser Extension settings
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select speed-tube-main folder
6. Ya done son - Gotta go fast!

Note: If you watch in Incognito/InPrivate then you need to enable it. Click "Details" for Speed Tube in Extensions then find the option to enable in Incognito/InPrivate and toggle it on. :)
