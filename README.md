Sometimes you just wanna go fast and YouTube does not get it.  
They cap your speed at 2.0, but I want more. This allows it.

Changes default playback speed and adds some keybinds for quick adjustments while visiting YouTube. Also sets default speed on new videos to 2.0x. Works on previews and shorts too.

"Z" --- decreases playback speed  
"X" --- increases playback speed

It is available on the Chrome Web Store. [Here.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/green-bunny-a-seamless-co/amgijocdfcmdoemenpngkdjokhkppili)

Alternatively, you can do this:

1. Download ZIP and extract
2. Go to browser Extension settings
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select speed-tube-main folder
6. Ya done son - Gotta go fast!

Note: If you watch in Incognito/InPrivate then you need to enable it. Click "Details" for Speed Tube in Extensions then find the option to enable in Incognito/InPrivate and toggle it on. :)
