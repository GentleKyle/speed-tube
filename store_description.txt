Green Bunny is a YouTube speed controller extension with keyboard shortcuts that seamlessly integrates with YouTube's existing playback speed interface. Unlike other YouTube speed extensions that overlay clunky controls, Green Bunny's enhanced video speeds (up to 6.0x) appear directly in YouTube's native settings menu for seamless video speed control.

How To Use:

Press:
"Z" - reduce playback speed by 0.25x
"X" - increase playback speed by 0.25x

Alternatively, go into the normal/default YouTube playback speed menu to see and select a speed from 0.25x to 6.0x.

That's it! Clean and simple.

WORKS EVERYWHERE:
- Full compatibility with regular videos, YouTube Shorts, and even video previews.

DEFAULT SPEED:
- New videos automatically start at 2.0x video speed.

UNLOCKED SPEEDS:

VISUAL FEEDBACK:
- On key press there is a non-intrusive display of the current playback speed that fades away after a short delay.

NATIVE INTEGRATION:
- Increased speed options appear in YouTube's own settings menu - nothing extra.

LIGHTWEIGHT & FAST:
- No noticeable performance impact. It is a drop in the bucket compared to what YouTube is doing. 

COMING SOON:
- Custom key binds, speeds, adjustment size, default speed
- Disable key binds while typing in search bar
- Adjust default speed based on channel (ex. music channels)
